# Drawing-of-RDJ-Using-python

This is a project that uses Python to draw a portrait of Robert Downey Jr. (RDJ), the actor who played Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The project uses the turtle module to create graphics.

## How it works

The project consists of a main file: RDJ.py.

- `rdj.py` is the main file that draws the portrait. It imports the turtle modules and creates a turtle object called `tu`.
- To run the project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You also need to install the turtle module using pip or any other package manager. Then, you can run `RDJ.py` from your terminal or IDE and watch tu draw RDJ's portrait on the screen.

## Example output

Here is an example of what the output looks like:

## Credits

This project was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg) by Kylie Ying, where she shows how to draw Hirst paintings using Python. I decided to apply the same technique to draw a portrait of RDJ, one of my favorite actors.
